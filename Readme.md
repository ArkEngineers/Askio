ASKIo is an advanced AI-driven learning platform that transforms traditional document-based learning into an interactive and engaging experience. ASKIo enables users to upload content, ask questions, visualize answers, summarize notes, and moreâ€”all in a centralized, user-friendly platform. By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), ASKIo makes it easy to turn static information into a conversational and visualized learning experience.
